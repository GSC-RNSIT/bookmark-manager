This project is currently being rewritten from scratch using Django, Djano Rest Framework, JSON-API, Vue.js, and Sass. It also lets you host your own site on AWS using the serverless stack so that you don't have to have a server running 24*7. Features that existed in the past may not be available right now due to the rewrite.

This project lets you create a personalized bookmark manager which lets you view your bookmarks at once rather than making you navigate a long tree structure to find your bookmarks! I also have plans of extending the scope of the project to support not just include simple bookmarks but also support more complex workflows and plugins. A part of the project roadmap can be seen [here](https://trello.com/b/QZwt27fR/bookmark-manager).
